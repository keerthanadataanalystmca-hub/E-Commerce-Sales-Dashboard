E-Commerce Sales Analysis & Business Intelligence Dashboard
üöÄ Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive E-Commerce Sales Analysis initiative that transforms raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence. It encompasses the entire data pipeline, from dimensional modeling and data processing to interactive dashboard creation and strategic reporting. The primary goal is to provide deep insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends, enabling data-driven decision-making.

üåü Key Features
Dimensional Modeling: Utilizes a star schema with fact_table (transactions) and several dimension tables (customer_dim, item_dim) for efficient data querying and analysis.

KPI Tracking: Calculates and tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales, Total Quantity, Average Unit Price, Customer Growth, and Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth.

In-Depth Analysis: Provides granular insights into:

Monthly Sales Trends and KPI Trend Analysis.

Top 5 Units by Quantity Sold and Top 10 Selling Products.

Store Division and Supplier Performance by Revenue/Quantity.

Geographical Sales Distribution visualization.

Interactive Dashboard: A visually rich and interactive dashboard created in Power BI for easy exploration and monitoring of business performance.

Wireframing & Design: Includes the initial wireframes and design mockups, illustrating the complete development process from concept to final report.
